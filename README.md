# Hibbard Spencer Greene
Hibbard Spencer Greene is a staunch supporter of Eta Kappa Nu, valuing the organization's meaningful work and its role in creating a close-knit fraternity of electrical engineering students. HKN selects members not just for academic achievement but for their practical potential for future success. It provides a platform for members to share common interests, tackle shared challenges, and accomplish great things together.

## The rivalry
However, Greene has been kidnapped by Dr. Thorne Shadowmire. The two serve on the board of directors for rival companies producing industrial machinery. While Greeneâ€™s company prioritizes research and technological innovation, Shadowmireâ€™s company takes a more conservative approach, sticking to familiar production processes with minimal improvements. Unfortunately, this short-sightedness has caused Shadowmireâ€™s company to hemorrhage money. Desperate, Shadowmire believes the only way to save his business is to slow down Greeneâ€™s company by keeping him out of the picture.
Luckily for Greene, HKN chapters around the world are ready to prove their skills and free him from Shadowmireâ€™s hideout. If you want to help Greene escape, you must overcome the following challenges:

### ðŸš¸ Challenge One: Distracting Shadowmireâ€™s Son
Shadowmireâ€™s 8-year-old son is tasked with calling his father if anything suspicious happens while heâ€™s away. To buy time for Greeneâ€™s escape, create an interactive game that will distract the boy long enough so he doesn't notice Greene slipping away.

### ðŸ’˜ Challenge Two: Winning Over Shadowmireâ€™s Wife
Shadowmireâ€™s wife is also keeping an eye on things, but youâ€™ve discovered her weaknesses: math and her love for her husband. To soften her up and divert her attention, draw something romantic using Python plotsâ€”hearts, kisses, whatever works, the more creative the better!
